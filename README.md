## Introduction

**Hello. This is my first ever datapack.**

At first I just wanted to create an exciting adventure map for my girlfriend but then it became even more exciting for me to actually create all of this.
So I decided to share it with the public.

A lot of code may be unoptimized, this is the second reason of publishing the pack.

Currently there is only a demo version. I hope people will see it, contribute (with explanations), and help me improve my skills and the datapack.

:pushpin: **And I mean it. I'd like to hear any feedback on any aspect of this world/datapack: source code architecture/structure, entities naming, commands optimization... heck, even colors or placement of the blocks. Anything.**

## Installation

:warning: The datapack is created on and for Java Edition 1.21.5. I can not guarantee that it works on versions different from 1.21.5. Also, singleplayer only.

1. Download [MCJ-with-reset-bat.zip](https://github.com/bl1te/Most-Common-Journey/raw/refs/heads/main/MCJ-with-reset-bat.zip).
2. Extract the contents into your _'saves'_ folder. **_Do not move and do not rename it! Otherwise edit the insides of _'MCJ-reset.bat'_ file!_** It should look like this:

- `.../%your_mc_directory%/saves/Most Common Journey`

- `.../%your_mc_directory%/saves/MCJ.bak`

- `.../%your_mc_directory%/saves/MCJ-reset.bat`

3. Start the game and load the _'Most Common Journey'_ world. **_Do not touch the 'MCJ.bak' world!_**
4. Run `/datapack list enabled` command to ensure that it was set properly.

## Restart the game

1. Quit to Title.
2. Close every other process which might be using the _'Most Common Journey'_ folder or its contents.
3. Run _'MCJ-reset.bat'_ file.
4. Navigate back to Singleplayer and load the _'Most Common Journey'_ world. **_Do not touch the 'MCJ.bak' world!_**
