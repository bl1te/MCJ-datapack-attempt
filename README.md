## Introduction

**Hello. This is my first ever datapack.**

At first I just wanted to create an exciting adventure map for my girlfriend but then it became even more exciting for me to actually create all of this.
So I decided to share it with the public.

A lot of code may be unoptimized, this is the second reason of publishing the pack.

Currently there is only a demo version. I hope people will see it, contribute (with explanations), and help me improve my skills.

:pushpin: **And I mean it. I'd like to hear any feedback on any aspect of this datapack: source code architecture/structure, entities naming, commands optimization, etc. Anything.**

Feel free to use any of the contents at your discretion.

## Installation

:warning: The datapack is created on and for Java Edition 1.21.5. I can not guarantee that it works on versions below 1.21.5. Also, single player only[^1].

1. Download the _Adventure.7z_ from the [Releases](https://github.com/bl1te/MCJ-datapack-attempt/releases) page.
2. Unpack the contents into your _saves_ folder. It should look like this:

- `.../%your_mc_directory%/saves/Adventure`

3. Start the game and load the 'Adventure' world.
4. Run `/datapack list enabled` command to ensure that it is set properly.

[^1]: While I enjoy messing with the code for fun, I'm not going to bother with multiplayer adjustments. And no backporting, ever. This is my philosophy: If there is a higher stable version, one should use it.
