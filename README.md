## Hello. This is my first ever datapack

At first I just wanted to create an exciting adventure map for my girlfriend but then it became even more exciting for me to actually create all of this.
So I decided to share it with the public.

A lot of code may be unoptimized, this is the second reason of publishing the pack.

Currently there is only a demo version. **I hope people will see it, contribute (with explanations), and help me improve my skills.**

Feel free to use any of the contents at your discretion.

## Installation

The datapack is intended to be used on Java Edition 1.21.5.

1. Download the _Adventure.7z_ from the [Releases](https://github.com/bl1te/MCJ-datapack-attempt/releases) page.
2. Unpack the contents into your _saves_ folder. It should look like this:

- `.../.minecraft/saves/Adventure` - if it is your main installation path
- `.../.minecraft/versions/{your_name}/saves/Adventure` - if you use custom installation

Custom installation is preferred to minimize the probability of your mods interferring the pack.

But it should work either way since I'm not using any _'world-affecting / -changing'_ mods during the development[^1].

[^1]: WorldEdit does not fall into this, right? It is just a **tool** for changes, not a changer by itself.
